AppSales allows iOS and Mac App Store developers to download and analyze their sales reports from iTunes Connect on the iPhone.

Features:
* Automatic download of daily and weekly sales reports from iTunes Connect
* Stacked bar graphs to see all your sales at a glance
* Show your sales on a world map
* View actual payments by Apple on a calendar
* Group daily reports by fiscal or calendar month to predict your next payment
* Automatic conversion to your currency of choice
* Download customer reviews of your apps
* Import reports that you downloaded elsewhere (for example with "AppViz":http://www.ideaswarm.com on your Mac) via iTunes File Sharing

AppSales requires the iOS 4.3 SDK. There is no iPad version at the moment.

Because there is no API to access some parts of iTunes Connect, AppSales scrapes itunesconnect.apple.com. This means that even small changes on this website can break AppSales. In most cases, this is easy to fix and I’ll try to make a new version available here.
