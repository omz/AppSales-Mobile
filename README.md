# AppSales

***Announcement***

*AppSales used to support downloading reviews, promo codes and payments. Because these features relied on scraping either iTunes Connect or the App Store, they have often not worked reliably or stopped working entirely when the iTunes Connect website changed. I haven't used these features a lot myself and I don't have the time anymore to patch them constantly, so I've reduced AppSales to its core functionality: downloading sales reports.*

*You can of course still use (or fork) one of the older versions if you rely on these features and can live with (or fix) the bugginess.*

AppSales allows iOS and Mac App Store developers to download and analyze their sales reports from iTunes Connect on the iPhone.

## Features
* Automatic download of daily and weekly sales reports from iTunes Connect
* Stacked bar graphs to see all your sales at a glance
* Show your sales on a world map
* Group daily reports by fiscal or calendar month to predict your next payment
* Automatic conversion to your currency of choice
* Import reports that you downloaded elsewhere (for example with [AppViz](http://www.ideaswarm.com) on your Mac) via iTunes File Sharing
* Optional push notifications when new reports are available via Boxcar

## Requirements
AppSales requires the iOS 7.0 SDK or later.

## Push Notifications
Because sales reports are not always available at the same time, I run a web service to send out push notifications when the daily reports have been generated.

You can get a notification when new reports are available with the free [Boxcar](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxcar/id321493542) app. Boxcar can also be installed directly from the settings in AppSales.

If AppSales is installed, opening the push notification will automatically trigger the download of new reports but you can also use the push service without AppSales being installed. To do so, install [Boxcar](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxcar/id321493542) and just add AppSales from the list of services in Boxcar.

Except for the total number of subscribers, I don't collect any data with the push service. You can stop receiving notifications at any time by simply removing AppSales from Boxcar.
