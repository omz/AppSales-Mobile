If you have been using this fork of MyAppSales, I strongly suggest you start using [@nicolasgomollon fork](https://github.com/nicolasgomollon/AppSales-Mobile).
He has made a lot of recent changes to fix some of the new login bugs and there doesn't seem any point in me cherry picking his changes when his fork is now miles ahead of all the others.

Any future pull requests, please send to @nicolasgomollon

Thanks
